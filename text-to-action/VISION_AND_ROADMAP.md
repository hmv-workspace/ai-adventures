# TextToAction: Vision, Plan, and Roadmap

## Vision
Empower users to interact with their digital environment using natural language, enabling dynamic, personalized, and intelligent automation of tasks that traditionally require manual UI navigation. The system should seamlessly bridge local and remote resources, integrate with external services, and adapt to user preferences, making technology more accessible and efficient for everyone.

## Guiding Principles
- **Natural Language First:** Users describe what they want; the system figures out how to do it.
- **Dynamic & Extensible:** Support for new actions, services, and integrations can be added easily.
- **Personalized Experience:** Remember user preferences, context, and history for smarter, tailored responses.
- **Safety & Security:** All actions are performed in a secure, permissioned, and auditable way.
- **Transparency:** Users can see what actions are being taken and why.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Natural language to code generation and execution (sandboxed)
- [x] Support for basic file, web, and system operations
- [x] Simple CLI interface
- [x] Animation/spinner for user feedback

### Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities
- [ ] Add support for more local actions (e.g., image, audio, video processing)
- [ ] Integrate with popular APIs (e.g., weather, news, music streaming)
- [ ] Allow dynamic tool selection (local vs. remote resources)
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add logging and basic analytics

### Phase 3: Personalization & Context
- [ ] User profiles and preferences
- [ ] Contextual memory (remember previous actions in a session)
- [ ] Smarter intent recognition and disambiguation
- [ ] Suggest follow-up actions or automations

### Phase 4: User Experience & UI
- [ ] Develop a web-based chat UI (React, Streamlit, or similar)
- [ ] Support for voice input/output
- [ ] Mobile-friendly interface
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

### Phase 5: Security, Permissions, and Enterprise
- [ ] Fine-grained permission system for actions and integrations
- [ ] Audit logs and action history
- [ ] Multi-user support
- [ ] Integration with enterprise authentication (SSO, OAuth)

### Phase 6: Advanced Intelligence
- [ ] Multi-step planning and agent-like workflows
- [ ] Proactive suggestions and automation
- [ ] Integration with more advanced AI models and tools

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Plugin/extension system for community-contributed actions
- [ ] Marketplace for integrations and automations
- [ ] Open API for third-party developers
